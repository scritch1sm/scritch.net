        Working directly with Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu, I helped establish the organization's technical direction, hiring practices, and studio acquisition strategy.  
        It was a joy to work with teams widely across the entire Netflix organization, from game studios I helped acquire and build anew to  Netflix product and technology teams that build the Netflix game services and cloud gaming platform.
        
        Most recently, I chose to focus more narrowly on leading a team whose mission is to explore what new kinds of games are made possible through powering games with emerging AI capabilities, with a creative and player-first focus.

We aimed to pivot towards high quality indie action gaming through crowdfunding to achieve greater control of our own financing and ultimately to create and deliver games to a community of gamers who love our style of game.

Unfortunately, we weren't able to reach our goals, but we did produce a pretty cool little concept demo built in Unreal 4 that many people found fun and we live demo'd at PAX, that we've now made available on a request basis on Steam.

Through this experience, we also learned a ton about things like influencer networks (like Twitch), presentation, and marketing.  And though this work, found ourselves connecting to a ton of interesting people that we wouldn't have otherwise.

It was a truly innovative concept, making a game filled with wonder and magical moments to draw in family players of disparate experience.  

Ultimately, the effort was cancelled by our publisher, Microsoft, as the priorities shifted there leading up to the launch of the Kinect.  

One of my highlights of this project was coming up with a game mechanic concept I call "seamless splitscreen", where the two co-op players are free to travel apart from each other and the camera seamlessly splits the camera into two sides to follow them, only to again seamlessly re-merge when they come back together.  It worked beautifully, and was a couple years before Traveler's Tales developed a similar concept in their wonderful Lego games.  I later brought this concept to Disney's Tangled, which is implemented as we had imagined.`,

We thought (incorrectly in hindsight) that the PSP was going to be huge, and people would be connecting with each other socially to play.  The game rewarded a winner in a multiplayer match by "infecting" the losers with their "virus" and you could watch your "virus" spread across the real world, visualized on a world map.

This idea turned out to be ahead of its time, now that we see the prevalence of social connectivity in games today.  I worked on the live multiplayer features and managed an external team that built the backend services to support the infection features.
