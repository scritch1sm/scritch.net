The game had received critical acclaim and Apple featuring, but was struggling to find operational health.  It was quite challenging to come in over a team I was unfamiliar with but was able to make traction in improving communication and team coherence while I could.  I was also able to lead an effort to shrink the game down to a < 100mb core game app for better distribution efficiency, with a secondary cloud download and help the company collect critically valuable data related to download behavior that was useful across all mobile games.  Ultimately, the company shifted focus and this game was sunset. 

My time after was spent helping the company with various management challenges related to preparing the company for sale, as well as co-leading a prototyping effort for a new game concept.`,

We aimed to pivot towards high quality indie action gaming through crowdfunding to achieve greater control of our own financing and ultimately to create and deliver games to a community of gamers who love our style of game.

Unfortunately, we weren't able to reach our goals, but we did produce a pretty cool little concept demo built in Unreal 4 that many people found pretty cool that we've now made available on a request basis on Steam.

Through this experience, we also learned a ton about things like influencer networks (like Twitch), presentation, and marketing.  And though engaging in these areas, found ourselves connecting to a ton of interesting people that we wouldn't have otherwise.

        description: `My Amazing Story, while ultimately cancelled, was the most exciting original IP game I've had the pleasure of working with.  This one was conjured at Planet Moon by the founders, including but not limited to Bob Stevenson and Nick Bruty.  

It was a truly innovative concept, making a game filled with wonder and magical moments to draw in family players of disparate game maturity.  

Ultimately, the effort was cancelled by our publisher, Microsoft, as the shifting tides receded away from our game just prior to the release of the original Kinect.  

In fact, it was most likely it would not have been possible to share anything about it at all, but somewhere along the way, pieces of unreleased material leaked onto the Internet, much of which I found collected here.  The team was heartbroken to see it die on the vine, but this is a tragedy many game developers must face in their career.

I was the lead programmer on this game.  But one of my highlights of this project was coming up with a game mechanic concept I call "seamless splitscreen", where the two co-op players are free to travel apart from each other and the camera seamlessly bifurcates the camera into two to track them, only to again seamlessly re-merge when they come back together.  It worked beautifully, and was a couple years before Traveler's Tales developer a similar concept in their wonderful Lego property games.  I later brought this concept to Disney's Tangled, which is nearly the same implementation that I'm pretty proud of in terms of contributing to the design of the product.`,

The thought was that the PSP was going to be huge, and people would be connecting with each other socially to play.  The game aimed to reward a winner by "infecting" the losers with their "virus" and you could watch your "virus" spread across the real world through PSP's.

While this idea was ahead of its time, now that we see the prevalence of social connectivity on mobile, we did have this working from a tech perspective.  I worked on the live multiplayer features and managed an external team that built the backend services to support the infection features.

The result is Jackpot Gems, which has been the game from our studio that has shown the best metrics in retention and LTV.  3 years after release, players still avidly play, despite minimal to no updates in the last year due to our move to Kabam.

Given different circumstances and better capitalization, I believe Jackpot Gems could have been a strong contender for top grossing spots long term.`,
