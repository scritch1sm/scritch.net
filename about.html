                    <p>
                        I’ve been fortunate to build a career in Games and related fields since graduating from UC Berkeley in 1999, starting in engineering but quickly finding I enjoyed combining it increasingly with leadership, management, game design, and business.  In addition to shipping games for LucasArts, Planet Moon Studios, and Kabam, I co-founded and ran Rogue Rocket Games.  I also was a leader that helped build Horizon Worlds for Meta, and bootstrapped Netflix Game Studio from the ground floor.
                    </p>
<p>The products I help build is an exercise of passion and a strong desire to deliver delight to players around the world, working with teams of collaborative and creative hard-working people who are willing to bring differing points of view for a better overall product.  Constantly learning and innovating is of top priority to me.
</p>
<p>My approach to leadership is built upon authenticity and communication and a philosophy of balancing high team performance and growth with fun.  A mantra I like to live by is "To make the most fun games, you gotta have fun doing it!"
