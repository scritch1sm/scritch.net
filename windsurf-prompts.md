# Windsurf Session Prompts (these are incomplete and summarized to a pretty reductive level, used only for my own reference)

1. "I need help with my portfolio website"

2. "I want to make a portfolio website that shows my experience in the games industry"

3. "Can you help me make a portfolio website that shows my experience in the games industry?"

4. "Let's start with a simple layout. I want a hero section at the top, followed by a grid of projects below"

5. "Add a mosaic grid of project thumbnails"

6. "Add an 'About Me' button that links to about.html"

7. "Make the hero section taller"

8. "Add a link to my GitHub profile"

9. "Update the project URL for Throne Together to point to the Microsoft store"

10. "Fix the modal close button position"

11. "Center the modal images"

12. "Replace the hero image with a side-scrolling space shooter game"

13. "Add the text 'RICH SUN' to the upper right hand corner of the hero-section area"

14. "Add the text 'Keys: W, S to move, Enter to shoot' in the lower left corner of hero-section"

15. "Add a little particle explosion when enemies are successfully hit with a bullet"

16. "Add a health amount to enemies between 1-5. their color corresponds to health. each bullet hit takes away 1 health. 0 health makes them blow up"

17. "Add a score feature, with a score number showed in the lower right of the hero-section. Each killed enemy gives a score of 2*(starting health). Each death loses 5 points"

18. "Move the button-container section to be to the left of the career-description section"

19. "Something is wrong, the button-container and career-description are showing up as rows, not columns"

20. "Please move the 'button-container' to appear to the left of the text just above it"

21. "Please debug: the 'career-description' section is not working. the about me button now appears above the text that starts with 'Leading game development...'. however, the request was for this button to appear on the left of the text"

22. "Make the space between the end of hero-section and career-description about half the size"

23. "Make the 'PROJECTS' header white text on a black bar separator"

24. "Please capture our entire cascade session from the start used to build this project in a file called 'Windsurf-prompt-history.MD'. itemize in order of history each prompt job requested in order in summary. don't consolidate into a single overall summary"

25. "Please list all the prompts used in a file called 'windsurf-prompts.md'"
